# MusicNoteGame
A musical intelligence test game to check your skills. A game for piano players to guess the heard note.
This was my student project written in C# with .NET Remoting client-server technology.

Please note that you will require to deploy the database to SQL server before you can use this game.
Feel free to modify and better the code as you wish.  I know there are improvements always possible.

Thanks
